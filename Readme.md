## Mission Statement
> Our mission is to ease the worries of safety with students at the University of Washington.      With worries of increased unusual night time activity in Seattle, it is important for us to      find a way to use technology to provide a platform to help students in easing their college      experience.

## Problem Statements  
*Big city / campus safety* - growing population   
*Safety of college students* - campus/off-campus safety  
*Early dection of noncommunitable diseases*   

The development of big cities and individuals living on college campuses, safety and risks of students has gotten worse over the past decade.

While universities and colleges take a high degree of safety measures on campus through providing actions such as more lights around campus, campus police, and night time transportation, many college students like to house in off-campus apartments, and the security right outside the radius of the campus lacks the degree university safety measures which evokes fear among the students in never feeling safe at night. 

- **Brainstorm on our collective scope:** <br>
  Find my feature with friends and notifications<br>
  Map reporting tool Calculating number of reports<br>
  Pairing up with walk buddy<br>

- **Updated problem statement:** <br>
  As student at the University of Washington start to live off campus, safety with students        walking home at night become a bigger issue.

  Many off-campus UW students struggle with finding a safe route home when it is dark out.         However, current existing apps focus more on students who live on campus and only records sites
  where crime had happened but do not record non-crime related factors that students may want to   avoid when choosing a route. 

- **Solution**<br>
  We envision a web map application that helps UW students identify possible dangerous routes and   sites ahead of any potential crimes or factors that people may want to avoid. The data used for   these sites comes from user reports and also official announcements like UW Alerts. A walking    buddy pair up feature would also be included for students to find walk buddies with similar      routes to walk together.
