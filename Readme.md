What are our problem statements: 
Big city / campus safety - growing population 
Safety of college students - campus/off-campus safety
Early dection of noncommunitable diseases 

The development of big cities and individuals living on college campuses, safety and risks of students has gotten worse over the past decade.

While universities and colleges take a high degree of safety measures on campus through providing actions such as more lights around campus, campus police, and night time transportation, many college students like to house in off-campus apartments, and the security right outside the radius of the campus lacks the degree university safety measures which evokes fear among the students in never feeling safe at night.

Updated problem statement: 
As students at the University of Washington 

Many off-campus UW students struggle with finding a safe route home when it is dark out. However, current existing apps focus more on students who live on campus and only records sites where crime had happened but do not record non-crime related factors that students may want to avoid when choosing a route. 

Solution
This web map application helps UW students identify possible dangerous routes and sites ahead of any potential crimes or factors that people may want to avoid (like homeless on drug).
