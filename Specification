## Mission Statement
> Our mission is to ease the worries of safety with students at the University of Washington. With worries of increased unusual night time activity in Seattle, it is important for us to find a way to use technology to provide a platform to help students in easing their college experience.

## Problem Statements
  As students at the University of Washington start to live off campus due to the pandemic and limited dorm capacity, safety with students walking home at night becomes a crucial issue.
Many off-campus UW students have little access to resources that can help them secure a route home that shows no threat to their safety, especially during night time. Furthermore, current existing apps focus more on students who live on campus and only pinpoint sites regarding previous crime incidents but do not consider alternative factors that students concern when it comes to choosing a safer route. To investigate further on such topics and learn about our target audience’s struggles, we conducted a survey among university students currently living in the U-District area.
  As the survey shows, 95% of our respondents have experience living off-campus (see Fig.1). Out of these students, about 79% walk home alone (see Fig.2) on a regular basis (3-5 days out of a week and above). It shows that these students largely feel unsafe walking home alone during night time compared to daytime (see Fig.3 & 4), which also supports our assumption that people feel more threatened while walking home at night time. According to the qualitative data we collected through the survey, there are four major conclusions: 1) safety threats of walking home alone are likely to affect a student's class/study schedule 2) students prefer walking home with other people than alone, along with being able to access and share specific information of their walk and the chosen route 3) although past crime incident is still the primary factor of choosing a route, students also concern information regarding other non-crime-related factors that are not universally accessible to them 4) few students have used any technology to facilitate their safety even though they feel threatened by walking home alone on certain occasions.

## Solution
  We envision a web map application that helps UW students identify possible dangerous routes and sites ahead of any potential crimes or factors that people may want to avoid. The data used for these sites comes from user reports and also official announcements like UW Alerts. A secure travel feature would also be included for students to schedule secured walks. According to the departure time and the estimated transportation time，if the user does not log in the website and click arrive with the time frame, an alert would be sent to the user’s entered emergency contact.

This is the landing screen of our website. Our website contains two main features: secured ride and incident report. Users can also enter their location and their desired destination to simply search for the desired route.
