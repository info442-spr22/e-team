##Delivery Schedule

Before Sprints: 

- We will be testing the high fidelity prototypes 
- This will be to gather information about pros and cons of our product which we will then implement into our MVP

####We will have two development sprints:

April 27 - May 8

May 8 - May 17

Our main features along with set up will be implemented for the first sprint so our application will be running before the second one. If there are any bugs, we will be able to fix them as well.

All changes will be deployed to production as they are completed.


**Milestones**

**Sprint 1**

- Set up Firebase – This will be completed on April 29th, 2 days into the sprint. This will just be a blank page that is unstyled and static. We should have all the set up so that the website is hosted, and everything is in line to start development
- Set up MongoDB – this will be our main database and be completed on May 1st where live data can be stored. We should have created our datatables and endpoints to be able to GET, POST, DELETE, and PATCH data into the MongoDB.
- Home page Feature – May 6th. This should be a dynamic map with data pulled from an API. This map will allow us to filter through locations and zoom in and out. Users will be able to click on a location on the map and it’ll return a longitude and latitude value.
- Live Data will be able to be stored by May 8th with reported incidents. Reporting incidents will be able to be used by users. Data will be stored through MongoDB on mLab and other users will be able to see this information


**Sprint 2**

- May 9th As all set up has been done in the previous sprint, it is time for styling to be done. Style Guide (font, color, etc is applied to all the pages)
- May 10th Placeholder text is edited to be real text for the page
- May 16th User Profile Page is created and users will be able to edit their information
- May 17th All Fonts, Colors, and everything are all uniform and compliant with design principles
