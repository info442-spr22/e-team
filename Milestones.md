##Delivery Schedule

Before Sprints: 
We will be testing the high fidelity prototypes 
This will be to gather information about pros and cons of our product which we will then implement into our MVP

####We will have two development sprints:

April 27 - May 8

May 9 - May 18

Our main features along with set up will be implemented for the first sprint so our application will be running before the second one. If there are any bugs, we will be able to fix them as well.

All changes will be deployed to production as they are completed.


**Milestones**

Set up MongoDB and Firebase – This will be completed on April 29th, 2 days into the sprint. Should have all the set up so that developers can start to develop
Home Page – April 30th This page should be static, deploy it onto Firebase and have either the basic pages to move to on the top screen. Should be static with place holder text
Map Feature – May 2nd. This should be a dynamic map with data pulled from an API. This map will allow us to filter through locations and zoom in and out.
